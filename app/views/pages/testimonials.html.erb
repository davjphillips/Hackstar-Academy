								<h6>Software Developer</h6>

	              <p>From the first day I met Christian, I felt completely comfortable talking with him and learning from his long and extensive computer expertise. He has a strong commitment that every person he teaches will learn to their highest potential and he takes notice of everyone's different learning styles to provide individualized learning attention to be sure they succeed. <br /><br />Christian would often initiate contact with me to check on my progress and help make it easier to ask questions. No matter what the question was, from understanding stacks to creating custom sort methods, he would provide clear, patient instruction that would help me understand on a much deeper level and wouldn't give up until I truly understood it through his insightful questions. Christian would also take the time to give meaningful personal attention such as taking the time to learn about my interests and inspiring me to come up with software ideas for them. Throughout my journey learning software development, I couldn't have asked for a better mentor and teacher and I would highly recommend Christian as a teacher to any woman interested in learning software development.</p>

		              <p>Christian is an awesome teacher.  Iâ€™ve found most developers extremely kind about helping noobs, but not always able to relate to why basic concepts seem foreign.  Christian is not only all patience and no condescension, but is gifted at explaining clearly how things work, all the way down to brass tacks.</p>

              <p>Hands down, Christian is the best teacher I've ever had. Learning how to program can be extremely frustrating, knowing when you should continue to struggle through a problem or ask for help is difficult for a beginner to discern. Without fail, Christian always knows when to push me to work through something independently and when to provide me with guidance. This taught me how to figure things out on my own, and know when a problem was too difficult, an essential skill to be a good programmer.<br /><br /> He always pushes my boundaries by asking me difficult questions, and never blindly accepting anything without fully understanding it. I could go to him with any problem, and I know that he would arrive at a thoughtful solution. Even with complex problems, Christian has an uncanny ability to break the solution down and explain it in detail. He provides a variety of comprehensive solutions, explaining the pros and cons of each. I still haven't been able to ask Christian a question he hasn't been able to solve. I hope one day I can become a developer and teacher like Christian.</p>

              <p>Christian was an excellent mentor. He is incredibly knowledgeable
							about many aspects of programming, but more importantly is a patient
							and capable teacher, explaining complex topics in accessible and
							engaging ways. I would recommend Christian to anyone, beginner to
