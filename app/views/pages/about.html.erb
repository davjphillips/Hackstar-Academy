							<br />
              <p>David enjoys programming, making music, and living in San Francisco.  He wrote his first program in Java when he was 16.  He also has a passion for good design.  Since starting his career at <a href="http://www.deloitte.com" target="_blank">Deloitte</a>, he has been lucky enough to start companies (<a href="http://www.ban.jo" target="_blank">Banjo</a>) and build products (<a href="http://www.getcustard.com" target="_blank">Custard</a>, <a href="http://www.bibbil.com" target="_blank">Bibbil</a>) that reach over a million users across the world.<br /><br />  After catching the startup bug, David started to learn how to build web applications using modern technologies like Ruby at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">DevBootcamp</a>, and Python. He holds a B.A. in Business Economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>

              <h3>Christian Fernandez</h3>
							<br />
              <p>Christian grew up on the tropical island of American Samoa, learning to hunt eels in the coral reefs. He applied those skills later to write assembly code to blit bitmaps in mode 13h (doing graphics with assembly is a lot like eel-wrangling). These days, he's hung up his eel gloves in favor of building network applications and teaching programming. He's been a senior software developer at <a href="http://www.telecomsys.com/" target="_blank">Kivera</a> (acquired by TCS), <a href="http://www.ask.com" target="_blank">Ask</a>, and <a href="https://fuzebox.com/" target="_blank">Fuzebox</a>.<br /><br /> He's also a founding member and resident python instructor at <a href="http://acemonstertoys.org/" target="_blank">Ace Monster Toys</a>, an educational hackerspace in Oakland, and was an instructor for the inaugural class of <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">DevBootcamp</a>.  Christian holds a B.S. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
